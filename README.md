# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: an `ArithmeticException` caused by division by zero. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides a corrected version.

The bug is easily reproduced by running the `bug.java` file.  The solution incorporates error handling to gracefully handle cases where the divisor is zero.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in preventing unexpected program crashes.
